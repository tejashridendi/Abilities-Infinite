# Abilities-Infinite
The title of the project  implicates positive outcome of invention and creativity of being different  instead of feeling of  lacking something. For example finger spelling or gesture recognition and many languages have come up to make communication in lives easier. This reminded me an incident of gap  of communication and shared the same with team which has led to an app confining to communication.

The objective of this project is to bridge the interaction gap between people who are impaired of speech and hearing(Signers) and the rest of society.
Sign language is not universal; people who are deaf from different countries speak different sign languages. The gestures or symbols in sign language are organized in a linguistic way.

Approaches to deal with gesture recognition:
1)Hardware based  approach     
2)Vision-based approach-real time compatibility and self-creatable dataset
(data glove, data suit)


Vision based approaches makes use of
machine learning techniques, Inbuilt-camera, digital image
processing techniques to extract the features of the sign and to
recognize it. It does not require gloves to extract the sign.
Vision based approach is found more suitable and practical as compared
to hardware based approach. 

Compared to device-based methods, vision-based methods impose minimal restriction to the signers. Any vision-based method concentrate on the properties of images in terms of shapes, color, and textures.

Keeping challenges of signers in mind and requirement of highly accurate system for real time:
The advancements in Deep Learning technologies
For e.g., Convolutional neural networks have made great strides in the field of deep learning in recent years.
CNN are major advances in computer vision (CV), and applications for self-driving cars, robotics, drones, security,medical diagnoses, and treatments for the visually impaired.
